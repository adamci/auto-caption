A series of experiments using convnets and LSTMs to generate text from images.

To start off with something 'simple', the first set of experiments will use Stanford's
Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset. This is both to serve as a warmup for generating text
from images, and will also serve as my final project for the [Udacity Deep Learning Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730).
